First take a vessel of your choice.
Add a glass of milk in it.
Crush and add 4 biscits of hide & seek in it.
Add 1 teaspoon of sugar,3 teaspoon of coffee.
Then stir it with a electric stiring machine. If you dont have that you can even use a mixer.
Pour it in a glass and add some chocolate syrup according to you.

And the cold coffee is ready to drink!

Remember if you use a electric stiring machine there will be choco-chips at the bottom of the glass and if you use a mixer they will be turned into powder.
